- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type
- Each device controller has a local buffer
- Each device controller type has an operating system device driver to manage it
#### Drivers
Help the OS use I/O devices. 
- Enumerar un dispositivo al conectar (Identificar dispositivo)
- Buscar un driver para ese dispositivo
- 
#### Interrupts
- Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the interrupt vector, which contains the addresses
