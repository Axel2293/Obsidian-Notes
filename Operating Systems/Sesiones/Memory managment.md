MMU - Memory Management Unit
# Background
Bring memory fron source to main memory (RAM)
Main memory and registers are CPU exclusive.
Register access is done in one CPU clock (or less).
## Protection
Processes get assigned a chunk of memory, and they are not permited to go under or above that limit (overflow, underflow)
