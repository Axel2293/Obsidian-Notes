# Threads - POSIX
Multiple tasks with the application can be implemented by separate threads
- Update display
- Fetch data
- Spell checking
- Answer a network request
Process creation is heavy-weight while thread creation is light-weight
- Simplify code, increase efficiency

## Types
### User Threads

## Kernel Threads
