## Embedded computer
Embedded computers are made to run a single or multiple programs that are integrated with the hardware and delivered as a single system.

Examples of embedded computers are the computer of a car, a microwave, a calculator, a mp3 player, a cellphone.

These types of computers are made like this to comply to power limits and costs.

## Desktop computer

## Servers
Large scale and reliable file and computing services.

**Backbone of large enterprise computing.**

4 points that make servers the best option.
- **Availability**
- **Scalability and throughput**
- **Responsiveness**
- **Reliability**

## Clusters/Warehouse-Scale Computers (WSC)
Result of the growth of Software as a Service (SaaS) for applications like search, social, networking, video sharing, multiplayer games, online games, online shopping, and so on **has led to the growth of a class of computers called clusters**.

- They are designed so that multiple servers act as one

## Super Computers
These are related to WSCs in that they are equally expensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, but supercomputers differ by ***emphasizing floating point performance*** and by running large, **communication-intensive batch programs that can run for weeks at a time.**

## Quantum Computer
Qubits can be made by manipulating atoms, electrically charged atoms called ions, or electrons, or by nanoengineering, so-called artificial atoms, such as circuits of superconducting qubits
