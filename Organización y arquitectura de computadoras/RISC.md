***Reduced instruction set computer***

Some researches show that simple instructions are more efficient to be executed.
- Instruction decoding is simple
- Pipeline usage is very efficient
- Response time to interrupt is more standard
- Normally, RISC is associated with Harvard architecture.

Basic RISC principle: "A simpler CPU is a faster CPU"

- Fixed instruction lenght
	- Simplifies process of fetching instructions
- Simplified addressing modes
	- Fewer and simpler instructions
	- Simplifies process of executing
