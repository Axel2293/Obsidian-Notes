A data model organizes data elements and standardizes how its elements relate to one another.
It explicitly *determines the structure of the data*, and shows *how data is used* for achieving *specific goals*.
The most popular types od NoSQL database models are:
- *Documents* databases
	- Store data as documents, not limited to JSON
- *Key-value* stores
	- Build data collections with records that are identified with unique keys for easy retrieval.
- *Wide-column* databases
	- Use the tabular format of relational databases yet allow a wide variance in how data is named and formatted in each row, even in the same table.
- *Graph* databases
	- Use graph structures to define the relationships between stored data points.
