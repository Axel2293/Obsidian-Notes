### Algorithm stability
If we look at the initial order of an array, even if there is repeated elements it orders the elements with the same order that they were in the array.
#### Insertion sort
This is a stable algorithm as it just moves the elements through the array, but it doesn't do jumps to move elements, so when an equal element is being sorted it will not be put in front of the other equal element, but behind.
##### Selection sort
This makes Swaps-Jumps between elements (pivot and minimum) so its posible that the order of repeated elements is changed or altered.
