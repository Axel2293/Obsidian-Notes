- Alternate or secondary flows are other ways to get from the same preconditions to the same post conditions from the same start point.
- They describe the steps that the same actor can take to achieve the same goal but with slight differences that the main flow
- They usually appear as a result of flow conditions/decisions.
- *There* could be *no alternate flows*, or there could be many.
- However, if a use case requires many alternate flows, it may be an indicator that it may need to be broken into smaller use cases.
# User Stories
El objetivo que tiene que lograr el usuario, esto debe de ser especifico
- A user story  *is a statement*, written from the *point of view of the user*, and **describes the functionality needed** in a solution.
- Typically User stories are *associated to* **Agile** *development*, but they can actually be useful on any development methodology.
- A user story is, in other words, the simplest statement about the software product that a stakeholder cares about.
## -Invest
Apart form being *SMART*, as a requirement should be, User Stories should apply the *INVEST* acronym.
- **Independent**: Each story should stand alone, *avoid dependencies* as much as possible
- **Negotiable**: Content scope, priority, form and function can be modified prior to implementation.
- **Valuable**: User Story should *help to solve a business problem*.
- **Estimable**: *Clear enough* to estimate the effort to implement it.
- **Small**: Each story should be implemented in a *single iteration*.
- **Testable**: Stories should be independently *verifiable*.
>[!sealso]
>**Spike** is something that we have to research about so that we can apply the things we learned from the spike.

## -Epic
When a user story is *too large to be completed* in a single iteration (or a predefined small period of time) it is considered to be an Epic.
- Epic need to be *decomposed into smaller* User Stories.
- Usually development projects start with identifying Epic stories, then refine, in general, all User Stories belong to an Epic
- In other words, User Stories
## -Title template
User stories follow the following template:
=="As an \<*actor*>, i want to be able to function, so that i can \<*Business_reason*>"==

The **shorter** version:
=="As an \<*actor*>, I want \<*function*>"==

To give emphasis on the business reason:
=="In order to \<*business_reason*> as an \<*actor*>"==

## -Content
Along with the title template, User Stories *require more information to describe the requirement*, usually user stories contain the following parts.
- Title Template
- Description
- Business Reason
- Acceptance Criteria
- Implementation Details
- Testing Notes
## -Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are used ad the rules or measures that the story should meet to determine if it has been completed and it works at expected.
- Most critical part of a User Story
- Is how the team knows they are done
- Is how the *actor* verifies the *function* provides the expected **Business value**
