- Alternate or secondary flows are other ways to get from the same preconditions to the same post conditions from the same start point.
- They describe the steps that the same actor can take to achieve the same goal but with slight differences that the main flow
- They usually appear as a result of flow conditions/decisions.

# User Stories
El objetivo que tiene que lograr el usuario, esto debe de ser especifico
- A user story  *is a statement*, written from the *point of view of the user*, and **describes the functionality needed** in a solution.
- Typically User stories are *associated to* **Agile** *development*, but they can actually be useful on any development methodology.
- A user story is, in other words, the simplest statement about the software product that a stakeholder cares about.
## -Invest
Apart form being *SMART*, as a requirement should be, User Stories should apply the *INVEST* acronym.
- **Independent**: Each story should stand alone, *avoid dependencies* as much as possible
- **Negotiable**: Content scope, priority, form and function can be modified prior to implementation.
- **Valuable**: User Story should *help to solve a business problem*.
- **Estimable**: *Clear enough* to estimate the effort to implement it.
- **Small**: Each story should be implemented in a *single iteration*.
- **Testable**: Stories should be independently *verifiable*.

>**Spike** is something that we have to research about so that we can apply the things we learned from the spike.
