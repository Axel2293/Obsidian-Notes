## How to write Non-functional
- Generate a separate document for each category, as:
	- NonFunctional requirements *apply to the entire system*
	- Refer to this docs when considerations are needed on functional requirements.
	- NonFunctional cats. often *involve different stakeholders*
	- Nonfunctional requirements require *own priority*
	- Keeping them together avoids multiple maintenance
## Good requirements
- SHOULD BE **SMART**
	- Specific
	- Measurable
	- Attainable/Achievable/Appropriate
	- Relevant/Realistic
	- Time-bound/Traceable
## Requirements as flow diagrams
