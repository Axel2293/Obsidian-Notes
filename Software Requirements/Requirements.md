# Validation
Prior to development phase we have to think how are we going to validate that requirement.
*Acceptance Criteria* in **user stories** will tell you what you need to validate (incomplete and vague)
Use Cases scenarios(flows) might be helpful but they are usually incomplete.

# Specification by example (SBE)
Use examples that surge in collaboration with the dev team. Usually applied in agile. First think of the examples and behaviour's, and then develop the code that make tohose come true.

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
For every class we have a testing class with methods that test the functionality of the main class.
Develop test cases, then develop main code.
