Multiple ways to measure performance
- Instructions per clock cycle
- Power
- Throughput
##### Response time
Execution time, time between the start and the completion of a task.
##### Execution time
Includes disk access, memory access, input/output, operating system overhead, etc.

#### Throughput
Total amount of work done in a given time

### Relative performance (ratio)
Means X is n time faster than Y. X/Y

Means the execution time on Y is n times longer than it is on X.

## CPU time
The time the cpu spends computing for only a task and does not include time spent waiting for I/O or data from memory.
Two divisions:
- user CPU time
- system CPU time

## CPI
