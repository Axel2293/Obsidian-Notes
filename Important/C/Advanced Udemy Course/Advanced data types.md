# \#define
It's a *preprocessor* directive
- Used to define symbolic, or manifest, constants to a program.
- Right at the top of the program
- By convention, names are defined using only uppercase letters and underscores
- Not managed by the compiler

# typedef
Create your own name for an existing data type
- Handled by the *compiler*, so it DOES check data types
